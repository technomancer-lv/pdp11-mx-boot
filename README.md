# pdp11-mx-boot
Bootstrap code of PDP-11 compatible MX controller
This code was posted in phantom.sannata.org retro computing forum by user XPOHOMETP. This bootloader was stored on custom made controller board in two K155RE3 ROM ICs. As told, CPU board was older model MS1201.01 that only had loader ROM for DX drive and punched tape. That's why he desigend this small program to boot from newer (in that time) MX format floppy drive controller.

This program can be entered anywhere in memory, or can be stored in ROM. Timer has to be disabled.
